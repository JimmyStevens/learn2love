# Chapter review

## Terminology

- **Operator** and **Operation** - Operators are symbols that cause an operation, or interaction to happen between two pieces of data. An example operation would be `5 + 5`. `(5 + 5) * 2` would be two operations.

- **Modulo** and **Modulus** - Modulo is a special type of arithmetic operation between two numbers using a modulus operator. The modulus is represented by a `%` (percent symbol). Example: `24 % 2 == 0`

- **Variable** and **Value** - Variables are names that reference a certain piece of data. The value is what is stored inside the variable: `variable = "value"`

- **Statement** - This is when you do something, like an operation (or group of operations), declare a variable, or invoke a function. For instance, this is a print statement: `print("hello")`

- **Invoke** - Run/call a function.

- **Parameter** and **Argument** - Functions tell you what and how many parameters they have. Arguments are the data that gets passed into those parameters.

- **Boolean** - `true` or `false`

- **Equality** - Whether or not two things are equal. This is usually done with an equal (`==`) comparison.

- **Loop** - Code that repeats.

- **Key** and **Index** - Key is the named reference in a table where data can be found. It is similar to a variable. Index is a key that comes in an ordered sequence, such as numbered keys in a list. The plural of index is indices.

- **Iterate** - Loop over a list and do something with it.

- **Scope** - An area where variables can be created that aren't accessible from the outside. Scopes are created by functions and loops.

- **Local** and **Global** - Local describes things accessible only in the current scope, such as local variables. Global things are accessible from anywhere in the program.

- **Shadowing** - When a local variable has the same name as a variable in a parent scope and prevents you from accessing the parent scope variable.
